DBT

We can start using it in two ways: 
either dbt cloud or dbt core

Both of have same started points the starter_project directory



pip install dbt
Note that, as of v1.0.0, pip install dbt is no longer supported and will raise an explicit error. Since v0.13, the PyPI package named dbt was a simple "pass-through" of dbt-core and the four original database adapter plugins. For v1, we formalized that split.
